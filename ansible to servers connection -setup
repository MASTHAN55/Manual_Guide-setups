1. Servers creation: 
    * cerate "5-servers" (1-ansible, 2-dev_servers, 2-test_server).
    * hostnamectl set-hostname ansible-server      (give randam name for all servers)
    * passwd root  (set custom password for root user, if you can see "successfully" it's good)
 
2. Do all servers:
    * vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config  (38,61)-uncommit   (giving root_user login permmisions)
       line-38(PermitRootLogin yes)        remove #-tag
       line-61(PasswordAuthentication yes) remove #-tag

    * systemctl restart sshd          (restart sshd (mandatory)        
    * systemctl status sshd
    * hostname -i                     (showing private_id)

3. Do ansible server only:
    * amazon-linux-extras install ansible2 -y                  (install ansible)
    * yum install python3 python-pip python-dlevel -y          (install python)

4. Do ansible sever only:
    * vim /etc/ansible/hosts                                  (go to ansible inventory file (or) path)
     [dev]  (Do-12-line Ex 1:)                                (adding ip_adderses inventory file (or) path)
       private ip-adderss of "dev_server-1"
       private ip-adderss of "dev_server-2"
    [test]      
      private ip_adderss of "test_server-1"
      private ip-adderss of "test_server-2"

5. Do ansible server only: 
    * ssh-keygen ---> Do-Enter "4-times".              (generating a new key)
    * ll .ssh/                                         (showing keys (id_rsa, id_rsa.pub).
    * ssh-copy-id root@ip_address of dev-server        (copying keys from ansible-server to dev-server (mandatory).     
    * ssh "paste ip-adderss of "dev-server"            (connection complete ansible to dev)
      ["Do all ip's same for connection"].

6. connection check(Do ansible server):
    * ansible -m ping all  :  show all connections (if you can see "success" it's good)
