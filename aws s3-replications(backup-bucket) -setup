                                                                                [Replication]

1. Bucket creation [Both buckets enable Bucket versioning]:
    1. source-bucket001
    2. dest-bucket002
    3. batch opperations    // for log info

2. Do source bucket:
    source bucket001 --> management --> Create Replication rules --> Replication rule name(rep-rule) --> Source bucket(Apply to all objects in the bucket) 
    --> Destination(Choose a bucket in this account) --> Bucket name(Browse s3) --> IAM role(create new role) Destination storage class(one zone IA) --> save.
