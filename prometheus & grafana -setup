1. Create servers.
  * Create 3-servers. 1-main-server, 2-worker-node servers.            [Node-exporter ---> prometheus ---> graphana dash-bord].
  * main server (Execute all-script)                                   (install "pegion.sh" script).
  * worker-1 (install node-exporter)  from git(pegion.sh)       (if you don't install node-exporter in worker nodes it will not work).
  * worker-2 (install node-exporter)         "

2. Do main-server.
  * vim /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml                 (if we can add another worker-node) 
  * vim /etc/hosts
    5.25.658.657 worker-1          (copy private-ip of worker-1)
    3.54.548.552 worker-2          (copy private-ip of worker-2)   

3. Connecting ports.
    PROMETHERUS   : 9090            
    NODE EXPORTER : 9100
    GRAFANA       : 3000

4. CONNECTING PROMETHEUS TO GARAFANA:
   connect to grafana dashboard --> Add your first "Data source" --> add -- > promethus --> url of prometheus --> save & test
  --> top of page --> explore data --> if you want run some queries --> top --> import dashboard --> 1860 --> laod ---> prometheus --> import 

5. Go grafana dashbord refreash and check host(option).
   * if you can see worker-1 and worker-2 it's completed.
